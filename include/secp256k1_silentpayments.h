/* This module provides an implementation for the ECC related parts of
 * Silent Payments, as specified in BIP352. This particularly involves
 * the creation of input tweak data by summing up private or public keys
 * and the derivation of a shared secret using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman.
 * Combined are either:
 *   - spender's private keys and receiver's public key (a * B, sender side)
 *   - spender's public keys and receiver's private key (A * b, receiver side)
 * With this result, the necessary key material for ultimately creating/scanning
 * or spending Silent Payment outputs can be determined.
 *
 * Note that this module is _not_ a full implementation of BIP352, as it
 * inherently doesn't deal with higher-level concepts like addresses, output
 * script types or transactions. The intent is to provide cryptographical
 * helpers for low-level calculations that are most error-prone to custom
 * implementations (e.g. enforcing the right y-parity for key material, ECDH
 * calculation etc.). For any wallet software already using libsecp256k1, this
 * API should provide all the functions needed for a Silent Payments
 * implementation without the need for any further manual elliptic-curve
 * operations.
