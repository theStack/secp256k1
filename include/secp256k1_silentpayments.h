/* This module provides an implementation for the ECC related parts of
 * Silent Payments, as specified in BIP352. This particularly involves
 * the creation of input tweak data by summing up private or public keys
 * and the derivation of a shared secret using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman.
 * Combined are either:
 *   - spender's private keys and receiver's public key (a * B, sender side)
 *   - spender's public keys and receiver's private key (A * b, receiver side)
 * With this result, the necessary key material for ultimately creating/scanning
 * or spending Silent Payment outputs can be determined.
 *
 * Note that this module is _not_ a full implementation of BIP352, as it
 * inherently doesn't deal with higher-level concepts like addresses, output
 * script types or transactions. The intent is to provide cryptographical
 * helpers for low-level calculations that are most error-prone to custom
 * implementations (e.g. enforcing the right y-parity for key material, ECDH
 * calculation etc.). For any wallet software already using libsecp256k1, this
 * API should provide all the functions needed for a Silent Payments
 * implementation without the need for any further manual elliptic-curve
 * operations.

/** Create Silent Payment tweak data from input private keys.
 *
 * Given a list of n private keys a_1...a_n (one for each silent payment
 * eligible input to spend) and a serialized outpoint_smallest, compute
 * the corresponding input private keys tweak data:
 *
 * a_sum = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n
 * input_hash = hash(outpoint_smallest || (a_sum * G))
 *
 * If necessary, the private keys are negated to enforce the right y-parity.
 * For that reason, the private keys have to be passed in via two different parameter
 * pairs, depending on whether they were used for creating taproot outputs or not.
 * The resulting data is needed to create a shared secret for the sender side.
 *
 *  Returns: 1 if shared secret creation was successful. 0 if an error occured.
